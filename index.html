      <p>
        I am <span>Sunday Temitope Toba</span>, and just like the vast and
        diverse continent of Africa, my journey has been an intricate variety of
        challenges and resilience. From navigating economic disparities to
        bridging the ever-widening technological divides, I have been driven by
        a relentless passion for innovation and a steadfast commitment to making
        a difference. Much like <span>AltSchool Africa</span>, my story is one
        of empowerment, and innovation, and the AltSchool Africa Software
        Engineering Program represents an opportunity for me to up-skill.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        The AltSchool Africa Software Engineering Program represents an avenue
        for me to delve deeper into the heart of technology. I plan to arrive at
        my destination as a highly-competent Software Engineer with modern
        skill-set.
